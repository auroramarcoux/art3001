        I met a ghost, but he didn't want my head. <br><br> He only wanted to know the way to Denver. <br><br> I met a devil, but he didn't want my soul. <br><br> He only wanted to borrow my bike awhile. <br><br> I met a vampire, but he didn't want my blood. <br><br> He only wanted two nickels for a dime. <br><br> I keep meeting all the right people-- <br><br> At all the wrong times
