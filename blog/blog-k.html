      For the instructional break and the holiday weekend, I traveled back home to Pittsburgh. I planned this trip a while ago, and with that came a list of things I wanted to accomplish while being on my little home vacation. 
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 350px; font-size: 20px;">workout every morning</p>

    <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 300px; font-size: 25px;">cook good food</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">spend time outside</p>

    <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 350px; font-size: 20px;">watch a high school sports game</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 380px; font-size: 15px;">quality family time</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">catch up with friends</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 350px; font-size: 25px;">take pictures</p>

    <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 300px;">selfcare</p>

    <p>
      Here are some things I actually did:
    </p>

    <p>ate takout food <br> my only workouts were short walks <br> slept a lot <br> spent time with family <br> did not take any pictures <br> did not take care of my skin and got a stye </p>
    
    <p>
      Don’t get me wrong, I still had a great time! Most importantly, my break was meant for time off of schoolwork. And I did that. My “relaxation” and ways to improve my mental health just ended up a little different than expected. I think this semester and past year in general has taken a toll on all of us. Selfcare looks different at different times and to different people.
