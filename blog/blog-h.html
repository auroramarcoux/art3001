    <h1>the weather this week…</h1>
    <h3>March 14th, 2021</h3>
    <p>
        Awesome. I never realized how much of a mood changer it can be. My housemates and I took daily house walks to campus and back. it was only a 20-30 minute-walk, but I feel like it made my day more productive and my mood instantly better.

        Since it’s been cold, I don’t have any in person classes, so I did not leave my house unless I had to get groceries. I didn’t realize it, but this made me a little sad and actually way less productive. Also not planning my day just made me procrastinate more, even though I had more time to do things.

    <h3>planning.</h3>

    <p>
        This is something I have gotten way more into since the pandemic. This semester I have a nice, big planner that I write in all of my assignments for the week, any activities or errands I have to run, and my grocery lists. I’ve also started planning my big meals for the week. I’ve seen that this has made a difference in my food waste along with staying on track in general.

        Tomorrow, I plan on making more lists and schedules just to keep myself on track. I also want to keep up with my daily walks and outside time. It feels just as important as the more “mandatory” tasks I have to complete. I also then don’t end up feeling guilty if I do something fun like going to dinner or watching a movie with my roommates, because I know if I stay on track with my schedule, I’ll easily be able to get everything I need to do done.

        Today, my roommates and I used our neighbors grill and made hot dogs, mac n’ cheese, and salad. It was a nice outdoor activity to break up our Sunday work we had to get done. It was also quite delicious. Even made me feel like I was back home! I also have seen people going to the fields and playing sports. Something I definitely want to start doing when it’s warm.

        I know this weather is quite the tease, because it’s about to be winter again probably next week. But, it’s given me a little glimpse of summer and now that’s all I can think about. I don’t want to wish our time away, but it’s definitely something we can look forward to!
