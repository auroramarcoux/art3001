        As said in my previous blog, I’m super interested in coding. It’s my major, it’s my future career, it’s something I find very interesting. However, I still like to express myself artistically (whether I’m good or not). I want to be able to spice it up a bit and make it, you know, less boring. The best way to do it all?

        I had a little trouble getting used to Figma at first, but I still think it’s very helpful. I’ve looked up some tutorials and I’m getting the hang of it for the most part, but I like to be able to screenshot it and make notes with extra ideas and tips.
