        My talk about being a comp sci major has probably gotten old at this point, but I’m here to bring it up again! 
    </p>
    <h3>you’re welcome.</h3>
    <p>
        This week in class we started talking about how java can be used to format a website, along with making it functional and ~cool~. This was pretty cool to me as I’ve been learning java since high school and throughout my college courses. Just seeing Hirad and Dalena start with the basics made me take a little trip down memory lane. I remember being in the same spot that a lot of my classmates are in now. Java is quite overwhelming at first and learning to code is a little...
    </p>
    <h3>scary.</h3>
    <p>
        This phase will go by quickly because once you get past learning the formatting, it’s pretty easy to relay that to different, more complex things later on. My coding courses now have shifted to another language, but as Hirad said, learning java and that type of coding is very useful. In C programming (what I’m doing now), the basic framework is a pretty close translation to java and the style of it.

    <h3>future.</h3>

    <p>
        This brings me to my career (which I’ve also talked about many times before here. Sorry, I’m excited), and I think this is going to be what it looks like. Taking my (still pretty basic level) knowledge of java and coding, I can know see my courses colliding. This class is also introducing me to a different style of java that’s not taught in my other classes. Therefore, I’m building on my past knowledge with new, fun, and relevant knowledge.  Exciting!

    <h3>enough of the nerd talk.</h3>
    <p>
        I cannot wait to take my website to the next level with all of this formatting and coding. It is such a nice break from hard, lengthy coding that has been happening in my CSE class. Labs and projects there are just so much different than here. It’s making coding fun again! Overall, this class has really just brightened my spirits and made me realize my end goal. Let’s keep it rolling!

    <h3>Also, I might start weekly quotes. Here’s a good one:</h3>
    <p class="heading">“The best way to predict the future is to create it” -Abraham Lincoln.</p>
    <p>(not sure if he actually said that, but it’s what google told me)</p>
