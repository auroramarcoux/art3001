    <h1>closing in on the finale</h1>
    <h3>April 11th, 2021</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">part 1: final project</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">
        For my final project, I’m expanding my community contact exercise. I recently decided to run for secretary for my Women in Math and Science club at OSU. The main role of this position is updating the website and social media and handling the gmail account. This made me think that I could possibly design the new website for WIMS, and my final project could be it. I want to make it fun and functional and easy to navigate.

        I also think after I finish the website on VSC, I’m going to transfer my design to a platform like Wordpress so other people who don’t know code can edit I too. That’s going to be a fun little challenge, but I am excited to learn how to use it.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">part 2: the class</h3>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">
        As we are getting down to the end of it, I’ve realized how much I’ve gained from this class. It’s honestly been a nice break from my everyday coding in my strict CSE classes. I do wish that I could’ve spent even more time doing my work for this class rather than my others. I think if I could’ve just focused solely on my work here, I would’ve been able to do very cool things. But major classes take priority. Priorities are hard to handle. I don’t like them. But I 100% will be using what I’ve learned here to experiment more on my own in the summer.

        Maybe I’ll keep you guys updated and continue to post some stuff on here. If you’re ever bored, check it out!
