    <h1>it's coming down to the end...</h1>
    <h3>February 26th, 2021</h3>
    <h3>projects are due in only 4 days.</h3>
    <p>
        But this project feels different. In the past when the due date starts coming around for projects, I get all worried and stressed. For this one, I’m feeling more excited and intrigued. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>here are some things I like:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>the overall layout</li>
        <li>i’m getting good with starting from a grid and making it look pretty identical to the mockup</li>
        <li>incorporating responsive elements, like hovering </li>
        <li>finding fonts off of google fonts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>here are some things I don't like:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>when I want to move something up or over just a smidge, and can’t get it perfect</li>
        <li>wanting to drag things to fix them</li>
        <li>my color scheme (I might change it after project 1) </li>
        <li>resizing with the window (I find it difficult sometimes)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Overall, I’m feeling pretty confident and I’m excited to go further. All I have left is to incorporate links and filling in some text. I also want to add some more cool responsive things, but those are finishing touches.

        Besides school stuff, my week has been pretty boring. I came home from a couple days at Penn State (booooo), took a couple naps, and stressed over my coding lab (not even close to finishing). I also went to the grocery store which was fun. My fridge was completely empty so it was almost like starting my overall diet from scratch. 
    </p>
    <p>I tried pickles for the first time last week. </p>
    <p>
        New foods that I don’t usually get that I did this time: jar of pickles, old-fashioned oats, oranges, salmon, hot dogs (idk?).
    </p>
    <h3>Anyways, here’s the quote of the week: </h3>
