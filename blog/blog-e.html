    <h1>what an interesting week!</h1>
    <h3>February 21th, 2021</h3>
    <h3>things that i did:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>road trip alone to erie, pa</li>
        <li>played in the snow again</li>
        <li>did not get groceries so ate a lot of takeout</li>
        <li>road trip with friends to state college, pa</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I drove alone to Erie to visit my boyfriend at school. Driving alone definitely allows for some thinking. Thinking about life overall is good for the soul. I’m grateful for my friends, family, and support system. Especially during covid times, I feel that it’s essential to keep them close. Checking in every now and then makes them feel good and also me feel good.

    <h3>it’s been a year since the world shut down.</h3>

    <p>
        That’s just insane to think about. A year of distance, loneliness, and constraint. But also a year of self-reflection, self-care, and motivation. It’s been the worst of the worst and the best of the best. It’s brought me some good things like new hobbies, new ways of meeting people and socializing, a new way of life. I think we’re getting the hang of things now, and I can’t really think of how life was beforehand.

    <h3>but, that might make the return that much better.</h3>
    <p>
        Right? Or will it ever be normal again? Who knows? I’m just waiting for that day and I think that’s what’s getting most people through it.

    <h3>my website.</h3>
    <p>
        On the brighter, happier note: the lonely road trip also let me brainstorm more about my website. I’m happy that I have it as a creative outlet during online school. It’s been draining me, but it’s good to have a break. I like my concept a lot, but I think I might play around more with the colors after project 1 is finished. I want to incorporate cooler touches as well like animated buttons and hovering techniques. Maybe also switch the mouse. Not sure.
